# HTML/CSS Learning Repository - Organized Structure

## Overview

This repository has been organized into a logical, category-based structure to make it easier to navigate and learn.

## Main Categories

### 1. Core Concepts (/core-concepts/)

**Description**: Fundamental building blocks of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with progressive difficulty levels.

#### CSS Concepts (/core-concepts/css/)

- **Selectors** (/selectors/): 6 progressive modules covering basic to advanced selectors
- **Box Model** (/box-model/): CSS box model properties and calculations
- **Positions** (/positions/): Positioning types (static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky) with practical examples
- **Flexbox** (/flexbox/): Complete flexbox mastery course with lessons and projects
- **Grid** (/grid/): CSS Grid layout system with practice examples
- **Typography** (/typography/): Font properties, text styling, and typography best practices
- **Combinators** (/combinators/): CSS combinator selectors (descendant, child, adjacent, general sibling)
- **Pseudo-Classes** (/pseudo-classes/): Dynamic selectors based on user interaction
- **Pseudo-Elements** (/pseudo-elements/): Selectors for styling specific parts of elements
- **Attribute Selectors** (/attribute-selectors/): Selecting elements by attributes and values

#### HTML Concepts (/core-concepts/html/)

- Forms, tables, and semantic HTML structure examples

#### JavaScript Concepts (/core-concepts/javascript/)

- DOM manipulation, events, and basic JavaScript practice

### 2. Practice Projects (/practice-projects/)

**Description**: Applied projects showcasing real-world implementations.

- **css-practice/**: CSS practice projects (blog post, navigation, contact form)
- **arun/**: Individual practice files and task solutions
- **manpreet/**: JavaScript and API practice projects
- **class/**: Class-specific practice materials
- **practices/**: General practice exercises
- Standalone projects: Calculator, weather app, pomodoro timer, portfolio pages

### 3. Resources (/resources/)

**Description**: Documentation, references, and learning materials.

- Design mockups (MOCKUP.md)
- Component structure guidelines (COMPONENT_STRUCTURE.md)
- Project structure documentation (PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md)
- PRD for TODO app
- Diagrams and flowcharts

## Key Improvements

1. **Logical Grouping**: Files are categorized by technology and concept type
2. **Clear Hierarchy**: Progressive difficulty from core concepts to practice projects
3. **Consistent Naming**: Fixes typo in positions practice folder (postions -> positions)
4. **Duplicate Removal**: Removes unnecessary duplicate directories
5. **Easy Navigation**: Similar concepts are grouped together

## Usage

- **Run Examples**: Open HTML files directly in a browser (no build system required)
- **Learn Concepts**: Start with core-concepts and progress to practice-projects
- **Practice**: Try the exercises in practice-projects directory
- **References**: Check resources for design guidelines and documentation

## Remaining Files at Root

Essential configuration and documentation files remain at the root for easy access:

- README.md: Project overview
- AGENTS.md: Agent rules and guidelines
- index.html: Main entry point
- Configuration files for VSCode and KiloCode
